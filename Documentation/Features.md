# Major Features currently under discussion
___________________________________________

TetraPlex will be a multiplatform communication and collaboration tool (Mobile, Web, Desktop clients) with some rather specific features not found in mainstream communication platforms. The features listed below are tentative and subject to change as we refine the concept and work towards a minimum viable product (MVP) and first public release.

## I. Asynchronous Communication Snippets (Com-snippets)

We are planning to implement a non-real time platform for communication based on the concept of a communication snippet that may contain text, audio and / or video that can be packaged in a container like a packet for distribution via pub / sub mechanism. 

The protocol should allow the mash up of content from multiple media sources and content types.

The protocol for such is still being discussed and evaluated but we are trying to avoid verbose protocols based on XML like [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) and a binary protocol is desired for performance.

The vision is the platform could serve as the aggregator of all your social media feeds and may serve as a time line of your total social media presence and this answers the issue with current social media and the fragmentation of your social media presence into multiple sites.  

Interested parties are hereby invited to join the discussion and develop this open source protocol with us.


Details to follow:

A. Base Protocol Specification

B. Integration points / Compatibility with other protocols and tunnels

C. Media envelope specification for the Com-snippet for aggregation from multiple media sources


## II. Semi Anonymous Veiled Communication

This addresses the need for anonymous communications as addressed in  our [pitch deck](TetraPlex%20deck%200.54%20-%20dark%20mode.pptx)

The veil is like a literal veil that you can put on or off as needed when you want to discuss sensitive matters or just want to enjoy some anonymity and we couple this with a Karma system to ensure good behavior even with or without the veil.

Details to follow:

A. Veiled Chats

1. Veiled Idea Generation (Brainstorm) chats
2. Veiled Debates
3. Veiled Job hunting (to ensure candidates are not judged by extraneous info)
4. Veiled Question and Answer

B. Karma System

1. Merit Points - what actions gain karma
2. Demerit Points - what actions reduce karma
3. Leveling and XP system for access to system


## III.  Secure Off the Record (OTR) Communication

Secure and private communication suitable for journalists and whistleblowers using [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging)

We also envision enabling easy use of [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) or VPNs with this feature for enhanced security and anonymity.

## IV. Kognitivdienste (AI API, chatbots and services)

Once we get a userbase we can datamine end user transactions while being respectful of privacy (one or more of our founders is in the EU so we take this very very seriously) so that our system can give better answers on top of typical user question and answer (with veil). This is later in the roadmap after we perfect the base protocol and do the veiled Question and Answer feature (for all the questions you are too shy to ask).

If you are really really shy maybe ask our soon to be developed bot... It won't judge you we promise.

Why Kognitivdienste because German is so much fun! (and other vendors use Cognitive Services)
