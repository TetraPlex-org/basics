# Major Features under discussion

## I. Asynchronous Communication Snippets (Com-snippets)

We are planning to implement a non-real time platform for communication
based on the concept of a communication snippet that may contain text, 
audio and / or  video that can be packaged in a container like a packet
for distribution via pub / sub mechanism. The protocol should allow the 
mashup of content from multiple media sources and content types.

The protocol for such is still being discussed and evaluated but we are 
trying to avoid verbose protocols based on XML like [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/).

The vision is the platform could serve as the aggregator of all your 
social media feeds and may serve as a time line of your total social 
media presence.

This answers the issue with current social media and the fragmentation 
of your social media presence into multiple sites.  Interested parties
are hereby invited to join the discussion and develop this open source
protocol with us.

## III.  Secure Off The Record (OTR) Communication

Secure and private commumication suitable for journalists and wistleblowers
using [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging)

We also envision enabling easy use of [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/)
or VPNs with this feature for enhanced security and anonymity.
