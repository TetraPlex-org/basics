# Why are you attempting to build another chat/social network app when there are so many?

We want to enable high quality communication even on connections that have high latency. 
Hence we went with the concept of a non real-time multi-modal communications platform.

# Are you open source?

Yes and we will publish the specifications of our async com snippet protocol as an RFC.

# Why is the Github still mostly empty?

We are just starting to ramp up this project although we had been discussing this for months.
Currently we are all part time in this project and if we do get funding we could be full time.

# Are you looking for other contributors?

Yes we need UI/UX people to join us also other people who love front or backend dev and co-founders.
