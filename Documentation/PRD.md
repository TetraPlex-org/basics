# Executive Summary

There are many social media apps in existence already but many of them amplify the wrong views (see fake news) or is toxic (see Social Media trolls and online bullying). This is caused by their business model of being free but serving online advertisements.

What will differentiate us from the competitors is a karma system that will promote positive interactions. While it is true that others like Reddit have a karma system but we intend to base what permissions a user has in the social network on user karma level (can be positive or negative).

We will also have a veil feature for anonymous chat that can be turned on or off at will for interactions that could benefit from user anonymity. The user can still have karma added or deducted based on end user ratings after veiled interactions.

We intend to use game theory to inform our karma system design to suppress trolls, fake news and all manner of awful content we see promoted in the current mainstream social media networks.

While we also intend to serve ads it is opt in and the user can gain karma by watching ads of their choosing. We will have other means to monetize on top of ads and we will save this in a later document.

This app will be a multimodal/ multiplatform application that supports text, voice, video and avatar chat on multiple platforms (web, mobile and desktop)

* Bob wants to have serious discussions and debates with like minded individuals and / or idea generation sessions (Veiled Debates / Brainstorming sessions)
* Carol is not serious at all just wants to have fun with people online, socialize and possibly use the app to make friends since she is socially awkward. She uses the veiled chats to overcome this and make friends
