# The business goals

A.	Product Goal

By the end of August 2024, have a functional asynchronous communications platform that is secure, easy to use and delivers text, video and audio of reliably high quality regardless of latency or network quality. The platform should be able to integrate with other existing communications platforms and support both veiled and non-veiled mode.

B.	Financial Goal

By the end of December 2023, have a business model that would ensure that we are cash flow positive on launch if possible and / or  find investors in our project to support scale up and customer acquisition on launch and pre launch and also validate this business model and pivot if required.

C.	Employee/ Cofounder Goal

By October 2023, find other members and cofounders of the team to fill gaps in our skill sets and / or develop the skills ourselves to build a great founding team on incorporation.

We aim to build a great corporate culture that welcomes all to join and develop themselves in an atmosphere of high trust, autonomy and accountability for outcomes and embrace failure as learning opportunities so that risk taking and experimentation is encouraged.
