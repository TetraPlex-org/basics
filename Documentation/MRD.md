# Market Requirements Document 

Author(s): Joel Alcarez, Anselm Kiefner

Project Name: Tetraplex

## I. Executive Summary

We assume that there is a need for a social network that is less toxic and is able to proivide better value for the end user compared to the ones that currently exist in the market. The existence of "fake news" and social media bullying highlights this need for a better social network with positive dynamics rather than the current ad driven model that leads to bad actors being amplified for the sake of ad revenue. You are the product being sold in these so called free social networks and this means they serve the advertisers interest rather than yours primarily.  We also want to serve ads but we will give more power and agency to the users of our social network and bring about positive rather than negative feedback loops in the system making the system better and less toxic the more it is used. To that end we will have karma and credits to help nudge the system in a positive feedback loop and rely less on ads than our competitors. 

## II. Vision

(something that we can share in an incubator pitch) 
maybe paste your vision and I can edit


## III. Target Market

It contains details like demographics and buying behaviors. The target market should also outline its size, potential growth, and 
relevant trends. (I think some of this is in the deck but we need detailed market research to justify building this and selling this project to potential investors) can we find someone proficient in doing market research?

## IV. Personas

* Alice wants to have her questions answered but is too shy to ask the questions fearing that her online reputation maybe tarnished

* Bob wants to have serious discussions and debates with like minded individuals and / or idea generation sessions 

* Carol is not serious at all just wants to have fun with people online, socialize and possibly use the app to make friends since she is socially awkward. She uses the veiled chats to overcome this and make friends.

* Dave is a role player and a serious fan of Star Trek. He wants to have fun and chat with random people as Spock.

(we need additional personas... who are our target users)

## V. Competitor Analysis

Identify and check the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. It involves researching their marketing strategies to gain insight into their business practices. (Yes we need this who are we really competing against...)


## VI. High-level Capabilities

These main features and functionalities should meet the target market's needs. Describe high-level capabilities without going into specific technical details.

(We will define what our product will do here... what... ) (how comes later)

A. Veiled Chats

Veiled Chats is a special communications mode that allows you to interact without revealing your identity. This mode goes beyond changing your user handle, avatar or text it also issues a special non reusuable identity token that cannot be traced back to your normal login in the system just in case the people your are interacting with online are technical and able to do digital forensics.

You can have a veiled chat as a generic anonymous user or use karma or credits to upgrade that temporary hidden identity to a special shared public identity (Public Personas) like Santa Claus or the Devil for fun. These chats are meant to help overcome social anxiety in participants in the social network and faciliate the flow of ideas when otherwise you maybe too shy or afraid to speak out.

B. Personas

Personas in the context of this proposed social network is like a costume you put on and assume identity of for some  indefinite period of time while interacting with others in the social network. They can be your own private persona and you can opt to have multiple personas if you got enough karma or credit or a public persona like Santa that you can temporarily rent for special occasions or for no paricular reason at all.

We can have virtual star trek ore furry conventions in the system in which paricular  fandoms and communities can "wear" their personas and have virtual social interactions as their persona with full roleplay senarios think of doing a Star Trek crew roleplay in a virtual Enterprise.

C. Karma and Credits

The system will have two currencies to facilite tranactions. Karma is earned by certain actions that the system deems pro social and is used to unlock some in network features and credit is cash converted into anb in network virtual currency.

(elaborated differnces further here)
    
D. Formal and Informal Debates

E. Question and Answer

F. Com snippets and async chat features

G. Avatar chat

(what else have we chat about just write it down I will edit)

## VII. Metrics

Measure the product's performance against the defined objectives. 
(how do we measure if we are less toxic ?)
