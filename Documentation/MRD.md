# Market Requirements Document 

Author(s): Joel Alcarez, Anselm Kiefner

Project Name: Tetraplex

## I. Executive Summary

We all know that there is a need for a social network that is less toxic and is able to provide better value for the end user compared to the ones that currently exist in the market given recent headlines and developments in this space. (see https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/social-media-is-toxic/43494) The existence of "fake news" and social media bullying highlights this need for a better social network with positive dynamics rather than the current ad driven model that leads to bad actors being amplified for the sake of ad revenue. You are the product being sold in these so called free social networks and this means they serve the advertisers interest rather than yours primarily.  We also want to serve ads but we will give more power and agency to the users of our social network and bring about positive rather than negative feedback loops in the system making the system better and less toxic the more it is used. To that end we will have karma and credits to help nudge the system in a positive feedback loop and rely less on ads than our competitors. 

## II. Vision

The world needs a communication platform that promotes the good interactions and suppress the bad interactions. We aim to be that better trustworthy platform where people meet, play, do work and essentially be their best selves liberated from the constraints of time and place. It is a place we can all be ourselves and help each other while rewarding each other for being helpful and nice rather than being passive eyeballs being sold we can be active participants in a virtual social space in which we can define ourselves as useful participants in a global setting in making our virtual and physical spaces better for all.


## III. Target Markets

The target market of our proposed social media platform is essentially anyone online using a smartphone, tablet or computer. The *global social media market grew from $193.52 billion in 2022 to $231.1 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4%.* (see https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/social-media-global-market-report). The increasing penetration of mobile devices worldwide is driving the explosive growth and hence we aim to be mobile first to capture as much of that market especially in developing nations. We are entering a market with double digit growth rates and is very dynamic with plenty of new participants in this market niche. We will differentiate ourselves from our competitors by addressing privacy and usuability concerns not addressed adequately by the current participants in this market niche and offer a platform that can be used for fun as well as serious communication. If we do eventually enter the superapp market with our credit system we will be entering a similarly dynamic market. *Global super apps market size was valued at USD 61.30 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.8% from 2023 to 2030* (see https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/super-apps-market-report). Being a superapp or a financial intermediary on top of being a communications and workflow platform offers a lot more opportunities for monetization and could mean that ad revenue on the platform may in the long run be dwarfed by other revenue streams. If we can tap the global remittance market to the third world from the first world we will be entering a similarly dynamic market. *The global remittance market size was valued at $701.93 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $1,227.22 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 5.7% from 2021 to 2030.* (https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/remittance-market). We will be based in the EU rather than in China or the US where regulations on data privacy are more stringent and aim to be a trustworthy social network and superapp (unlike our competitors) and be a more trustworthy app focused on long term sustainable growth rather than short term gains at the expense of end user trust and goodwill.


## IV. Personas

* Alice wants to have her questions answered but is too shy to ask the questions fearing that her online reputation maybe tarnished

* Bob wants to have serious discussions and debates with like minded individuals and / or idea generation sessions 

* Carol is not serious at all just wants to have fun with people online, socialize and possibly use the app to make friends since she is socially awkward. She uses the veiled chats to overcome this and make friends.

* Dave is a role player and a serious fan of Star Trek. He wants to have fun and chat with random people as Spock.

* Eva works in the US as a nurse and miss her very young children in the Philippines. She uses our pltform to chat with them using fun kid friendly personas sometimes and use or credit system to send cash home.

* Frank is an entrepreneur and wants someone to test his new web platform. He pays credits to the system, the system takes transaction fees and a freelance tester does the task and files a report for a bounty claim, the tester gets paid in credits after Frank sees the report.

(we need additional personas... who are our target users)

## V. Competitor Analysis

Identify and check the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. It involves researching their marketing strategies to gain insight into their business practices. (Yes we need this who are we really competing against...)


## VI. High-level Capabilities

These main features and functionalities should meet the target market's needs. Describe high-level capabilities without going into specific technical details.

(We will define what our product will do here... what... why...) (how comes later)

A. Veiled Chats

Veiled Chats is a special communications mode that allows you to interact without revealing your identity. This mode goes beyond changing your user handle, avatar or text it also issues a special non reusable identity token that cannot be traced back to your normal login in the system just in case the people you are interacting with online are technical and able to do digital forensics.
You can have a veiled chat as a generic anonymous user or use karma or credits to upgrade that temporary hidden identity to a special shared public identity (Public Personas) like Santa Claus or the Devil for fun. These chats are meant to help overcome social anxiety in participants in the social network and faciliate the flow of ideas when otherwise you maybe too shy or afraid to speak out.

B. Personas

Personas in the context of this proposed social network is like a costume you put on and assume identity of for some indefinite period of time while interacting with others in the social network. They can be your own private persona and you can opt to have multiple personas if you got enough karma or credit or a public persona like Santa that you can temporarily rent for special occasions or for no paricular reason at all.

We can have virtual Star Trek or furry conventions in the system in which paricular  fandoms and communities can "wear" their personas and have virtual social interactions as their persona with full roleplay senarios think of doing a Star Trek crew roleplay in a virtual Enterprise or just plain interactions in a virtual fanbase specific convention. You can also be your persona essentially forever in this network if you own that specific persona. 

We can have a persona marketplace where artists can make 2D or 3D graphics that could go along well with a particular OC or original character as well as a fully formed character backstory (if a serious roleplayer desireth such).

C. Persona / Avatar Marketplace

There can be a marketplace where you can design your (OC) or  Original Character and essentially rent this out for credits in the system for anyone who wants to use said character for a given time period in the system. The system will also have public system avatars either for rent or free or available in exchange or karma.

Think of this marketplace as a costume or character shop where you can if you can afford with karma  or credits become your favourite cartoon character or superhero or be some mythical sea creature. 

D. Avatar Design / Import

The end user can import images for their avatar which is initially 2D but can eventually be 3D. A designer tool for avatars is out of scope but possible in the future

E. Avatar chat

We can have 3D gesture based chat but this is reserved for a future version probably aimed at a desktop client.

F. Karma and Credits

The system will have two currencies to facilitate tranactions. Karma is earned by certain actions that the system deems pro social and is used to unlock some in network features and credit is cash converted into an in network virtual currency to buy virtual and possibly physical goods and set and pay bounties for certain tasks. This credit system can eventually be expanded to the point that we can become a superapp. (And compete with X and the Chinese Superapps) 

The advantage we have is that we are designing from scratch and building in privacy unlike the abovementioned superapps and we will be based in the EU which is a well known advocate of not collecting too much information from the users of online platforms. We will be totally transparent as to what data we collect and why and will have options for deleting financial transactions after some time if no claims of fraud or wrong doing with regards to aforementioned transactions are made.

G. Bounties and Tasks

Users can set bounties for any task in the system with credits and get volunteers to work on these in exchange for credits.
    
H. Formal and Informal Debates

1. Formal Debates can be Oxford style debates among individuals or teams. Teams can adopt a Team Persona for the duration of the said debate and appear in the system as a single character voicing all their collective arguments. The Oxford style debates are a common format in professional debate circles and explanation of the said format can be found in this link (see https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/oxford)
There will be formal winners and losers in the debates decided by votes as outlined in the link.

2. Informal Debates can be practice sessions and a vote after the debate is optional

I. Organizations and Guilds
We will support organizations/guilds as a native entity in the system with membership and rules defined by the organization admin. This can be like discord communities and / or  schools or corporate or governmental entities or non profit organizations.
We can  be the platform of choice for organizing and executing actions after consensus in a given group is reached or simply a means of having fun and socializing. We will not control the aims of these groups as they are free to do as they please as long as no laws are broken and everyone's interests are protected.

J. Voting and Consensus Platform

We will support various voting systems and one of them is examined in detail in this document (see https://github.com/TetraPlex-org/basics/blob/main/Documentation/technical/voting.md). Group consensus is essential in many organizations and beng consulted upon helps build group cohesion prior to any major activity that may affect the members of the group. This feature can be a corporate decision makimg aid as well as a means of ensuring the group members have say in pertinent issues. 

K. Question and Answer System

We can have a system where user who is frustrated at not having the right answer found can ask while using the veil and get answers from other users ion the system. The incentive for those that answer these questions can come in many forms.

1. Skill rating increase in a particular skill rating category
2. Karma
3. Credits if bounty for a particularly difficult and urgent question is set.

We can define other rewards in the future and those are merely indicative of what is possible.
This can eventually build up to a collective knowledge base that shall be searchable and ranked by up votes and down votes in a given category. Corporations can use this tool to build custom knowledge bases and these can be made private and hosted in their own cloud or server platform for a fee if they fear leakage of proprietary corporate information.

L. Skills Rating System

M. Com snippets and async chat features


(what else have we chat about just write it down I will edit)

## VII. Metrics

We aim to measure up to our lofty ambitions of being the less toxic, enlightened and useful social network by many means but primarily with objective metrics user acquisition and churn rate (how many users go use our platform and stay there) and subjective metrics like end user statisfaction surveys that a random sample of end users can opt to take to gain karma in the system. We will use these metrics to drive improvements in end user loyalty and become the best social network in the planet by any given metric eventually. Once again our advantage over the incumbents is that their ad based model is their life blood and they can't really pivot away from that business model without killing or severely damaging their very profitable online ad sales business. We can rely less on ads and make ads optional to users who want to support us by watching an ad of their choice. (So another metric is ads watched per month) and user subscriptions for an ad free experience (Another metric is total monthly subscribers). These aren't a comprehensive list of the metrics we can and will use to drive the system into a positive feedback loop and are only indicative of what is possible if we get this running.
