## I. Executive Summary

We assume that there is a need for a social network that is less toxic and is able to proivide better value for the end user compared to the ones that currently exist in the market. The existence of "fake news" and social media bullying highlights this need for a better social network with positive dynamics rather than the current ad driven model that leads to bad actors being amplified for the sake of ad revenue. You are the product being sold in these so called free social networks and this means they serve the advertisers interest rather than yours primarily.  We also want to serve ads but we will give more power and agency to the users of our social network and bring about positive rather than negative feedback loops in the system making the system better and less toxic the more it is used. To that end we will have karma and credits to help nudge the system in a positive feedback loop and rely less on ads than our competitors. 

## II. Vision

(something that we can share in an incubator pitch)


## III. Target Market
It contains details like demographics and buying behaviors. The target market should also outline its size, potential growth, and relevant trends. (I think som of this is in the deck but we need detaile market research to justify building this

## IV. Personas

* Alice wants to have her questions answered but is too shy to ask the questions fearing that her online reputation maybe tarnished

* Bob wants to have serious discussions and debates with like minded individuals and / or idea generation sessions 

* Carol is not serious at all just wants to have fun with people online, socialize and possibly use the app to make friends since she is socially awkward. She uses the veiled chats to overcome this and make friends

## V. Competitor Analysis
Identify and check the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. It involves researching their marketing strategies to gain insight into their business practices.


## VI. High-level Capabilities

(We will define what our product will do here... what... ) (how comes later)

The core feature of the product is the veiled chat
