# Market Requirements Document

Project Name: Tetraplex

## I. Executive Summary

We assume that there is a need for a social network that is less toxic and is able to provide better value for the end user compared to the ones that currently exist in the market. The existence of "fake news" and social media bullying highlights this need for a better social network with positive dynamics rather than the current ad driven model that leads to bad actors being amplified for the sake of ad revenue. You are the product being sold in these so called free social networks and this means they serve the advertisers interest rather than yours primarily.  We also want to serve ads but we will give more power and agency to the users of our social network and bring about positive rather than negative feedback loops in the system making the system better and less toxic the more it is used. To that end we will have karma and credits to help nudge the system in a positive feedback loop and rely less on ads than our competitors. 

## II. Vision

(something that we can share in an incubator pitch) 
maybe paste your vision and I can edit


## III. Target Market

The target market of our proposed social media platform is essentially anyone online using a smartphone, tablet or computer. The global social media market grew from $193.52 billion in 2022 to $231.1 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4%. (see https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/social-media-global-market-report). The increasing penetration of mobile devices worldwide is driving the explosive growth and hence we aim to be mobile first to capture as much of that market especially in developing nations. We are entering a market with double digit growth rates and is very dynamic with plenty of new participants in this market niche. We will differentiate ourselves from our competitors by addressing privacy and usuability concerns not addressed adequately by the current participants in this market niche and offer a platform that can be used for fun as well as serious communication. If we do eventually enter the superapp market with our credit system we will be entering a similarly dynamic market gobal super apps market size was valued at USD 61.30 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.8% from 2023 to 2030 (see https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/super-apps-market-report).

Being a superapp or a financial intermediary on top of being a communications and workflow platform offers a lot more opportunities for monetization and could mean that ads revenue on the platform may in the long run be dwarfed by other revenue streams. If we can tap the global remittance market to the third world from the first world we will be taping a similarly dynamic market. The global remittance market size was valued at $701.93 billion in 2020, and is projected to reach $1,227.22 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 5.7% from 2021 to 2030. (https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/remittance-market).

We will be based in the EU rather than in China or the US where regulations on data privacy are more stringent and aim to be a trustwortgy social network and superapp (unlike our competitors).




## IV. Personas

* Alice wants to have her questions answered but is too shy to ask the questions fearing that her online reputation maybe tarnished

* Bob wants to have serious discussions and debates with like minded individuals and / or idea generation sessions 

* Carol is not serious at all just wants to have fun with people online, socialize and possibly use the app to make friends since she is socially awkward. She uses the veiled chats to overcome this and make friends.

* Dave is a role player and a serious fan of Star Trek. He wants to have fun and chat with random people as Spock.

* Eva works in the US as a nurse and miss her very young children in the Philippines. She uses our pltform to chat with them using fun kid friendly personas sometimes and use or credit system to send cash home.

(we need additional personas... who are our target users)

## V. Competitor Analysis

Identify and check the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors. It involves researching their marketing strategies to gain insight into their business practices. (Yes we need this who are we really competing against...)


## VI. High-level Capabilities

These main features and functionalities should meet the target market's needs. Describe high-level capabilities without going into specific technical details.

(We will define what our product will do here... what... ) (how comes later)

A. Veiled Chats

Veiled Chats is a special communications mode that allows you to interact without revealing your identity. This mode goes beyond changing your user handle, avatar or text it also issues a special non reusuable identity token that cannot be traced back to your normal login in the system just in case the people your are interacting with online are technical and able to do digital forensics.

You can have a veiled chat as a generic anonymous user or use karma or credits to upgrade that temporary hidden identity to a special shared public identity (Public Personas) like Santa Claus or the Devil for fun. These chats are meant to help overcome social anxiety in participants in the social network and faciliate the flow of ideas when otherwise you maybe too shy or afraid to speak out.

B. Personas

Personas in the context of this proposed social network is like a costume you put on and assume identity of for some indefinite period of time while interacting with others in the social network. They can be your own private persona and you can opt to have multiple personas if you got enough karma or credit or a public persona like Santa that you can temporarily rent for special occasions or for no paricular reason at all.

We can have virtual Star Trek or furry conventions in the system in which paricular  fandoms and communities can "wear" their personas and have virtual social interactions as their persona with full roleplay senarios think of doing a Star Trek crew roleplay in a virtual Enterprise or just plain interactions in a virtual fanbase specific convention. You can also be your persona essentially forever in this network if you own that specific persona. 

We can have a persona marketplace where artists can make 2D or 3D graphics that could go along well with a particular OC or original character as well as a fully formed character backstory (if a serious roleplayer desireth such).

C. Karma and Credits

The system will have two currencies to facilitate tranactions. Karma is earned by certain actions that the system deems pro social and is used to unlock some in network features and credit is cash converted into an in network virtual currency to buy virtual and possibly physical goods and set and pay bounties for certain tasks. This credit system can eventually be expanded to the point that we can become a superapp. (And compete with X and the Chinese Superapps) 

The advantage we have is that we are designing from scratch and building in privacy unlike the abovementioned superapps and we will be based in the EU which is a well known advocate of not collecting too much information from the users of online platforms. We will be totally transparent as to what data we collect and why and will have options for deleting financial transactions after some time if no claims of fraud or wrong doing with regards to aforementioned transactions are made.
    
D. Formal and Informal Debates

E. Question and Answer

F. Com snippets and async chat features

G. Avatar chat

(what else have we chat about just write it down I will edit)

## VII. Metrics

Measure the product's performance against the defined objectives. 
(how do we measure if we are less toxic ?)
