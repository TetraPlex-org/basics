# EIC Accelerator Program Short Application

## 1. Problem/market opportunity
There is no European super-app or social media platform with integrated payments and workflows that can compete with the Chinese and even the existing American social media giants. There also have been growing concerns over the security of the Chinese, as well as the toxicity and lack of adequate moderation of the ad-driven American social media platforms. It is worrying that social media giants are collecting far too much personal information to feed us advertising, or worse, enable state actors to use them to monitor and manipulate their citizens and gather intel against political opposition.

We need a European champion in this area that will promote liberal western values and be a platform for open debate and discussion without the toxicity of the current Web 2.0 platforms or the relative immaturity of the Web 3.0 frameworks. Almost all the technology required for realizing our platform is mature and matches TRL requirements. We can step in and be the European super-app that will be both trustworthy, being based in Europe where we care about data privacy and governance and be pro-social without the social engineering Chinese style.

Innovations come in many forms, and it does not have to be technical. Countless mature technologies can be applied in ways that are innovative in a social or business sense. We will be a social network that can even be used in developing countries with mature technologies applied in a socially conscious manner, appropriate to target high-growth markets. We have several technical innovations qualifying as research or proof-of-concept in the works, but we will aim to make our platform usable on low-end smartphones and laptops used primarily in poor regions of the world. These technological innovations are non-essential for the success of the platform, but will make the platform more useful and productive.

We will bring the world together without dissolving identity differences, just as the EU brought together former adversaries and deepened our understanding at an individual as well as at a transnational level. We will be a safe space for discussions and transactions online where we can all agree to disagree safely without the toxicity of existing platforms and find common ground and cooperate on matters of utmost importance.


## 2. The Innovation: Solution/Product or Services (USP)
We are proposing a social network that lets users fine-tune their exposure to the virtual and real world via different layers and mechanisms to provide degrees of anonymity. At the same time, we will be a safe space thanks to layered community-centric moderation feedback mechanisms. 
Trust can only be built over time. Our system allows you to interact with others by what we call “personas”, similar to virtual masks, that you can use for different purposes. A persona will eventually include a 3D avatar (including a fully featured 3D home) like in VR Chat. Still, it can be 2D as well so that our main functionality can also be available on low-end mobile devices. However, a persona is not just the visual representation of the user. It includes all sensitive personal details like memberships in organizations and circles of friends, birthdays, location, gender and more. Personas will be much more than filters known from current video chat applications in communication between users. Abstracting the transmission to the persona level will minimize the amount of data needed while ensuring a smooth experience. It will also avoid filter-related problems, potentially exposing details about your personal life. 
Many people, notably the furry community, already use personas online to be less shy and socially awkward. Other communities will benefit from the persona concept as an identity facade rather than a niche concept found in a few online communities and marketing literature. We are proposing a social network in which identity is fluid while having ways to determine whom to trust based on prior interactions on the platform via karma and skill ratings attached to the underlying identity behind the persona. People can use these personas to explore communities in the network that accept them based on their behaviour and character, not being judged or bullied by their appearance and other superficial criteria.  There is research showing that [strong individual or group identities more often divide us](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-identity-not-issues-explains-the-partisan-divide/) that unite us. Making identity fluid in the system may help us step in the shoes of others and help build empathy to those who are different from us. We can have features that encourage exploration of both identity and ideas and the ability to safely explore them in a non toxic environment that encourages positive interaction and exploration.
In positive interactions with the community, notably by helping in veiled Q|A sessions, users gain karma they can use to unlock community-related features. Reporting problematic behaviour results in disclosure to ad-hoc community tribunals, whose judgement can be appealed and escalated to a regional and a global moderation team. Punishment can be fine-tuned and include the revocation and future denial of specific karma-unlocked features, allowing for a much better-balanced moderation to the classic all-or-nothing kick/ban punishments. Denying particular features instead of just removing the user from the network also reduces the appeal for the affected user to circumvent the technical restrictions. Instead, it is much more appealing to correct the toxic behaviour and learn to become a productive community member.


## 3. Market and Competition analysis

Market and Competition Analysis
We are primarily competing in the [Anonymous Social Media Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_social_media) and the [general social media space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media). Long term the social market space is exhibits healthy growth. [Total revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2022-2027) of 6.86%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$183.10bn by 2027.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/social-networking/worldwide). Obtaining less than 1% of that can make us a [unicorn](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unicorn.asp) and we do need [more EU unicorns in the tech space](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2021/03/25/exclusive-europe-must-close-huge-tech-gap-says-eu-digital-chief/). It is still very much possible to obtain viral growth see [Tiktok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok) that had a launch in 2017. If we don't have the courage and will to compete in this large and dynamic market we will cede this by default to the Americans and the Chinese.
As for the anonymous Social Media space, the users there may lack moderation; hence, these aren't mainstream, and there have been [reports of harassment and cyber bullying on these platforms](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/10/living/parents-new-apps-bullying/index.html).
[Facebook and the old traditional social media can be seen as uncool by kids.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-midlife-crisis-boomerbook/620307/). Many now do try out these newer social media sites and apps, and some of these are anonymous.
We aim to be the incredible new anonymous social media platform while being safe for use due to karma and kid personas for the underaged.

## 4. Broad Impacts

Aside from the direct jobs created in the EU as well as attracting qualified labor and talent into the EU rather than in China or the US, our platform can create part-time jobs as a gig economy platform via bounties and commissions set for various tasks by network participants in a global scale.

We aim to [address concerns that these gig economy platforms are platforms for worker exploitation](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/the-gig-is-up-on-21st-century-exploitation/) rather than empowerment by giving more power to the gig economy participants to set parameters on engagement be it by reversing the model and making others bid for your time and effort via [commission slots](https://www.reddit.com/r/artbusiness/comments/v8l1rs/what_are_commission_slots_and_what_exactly_is/?rdt=63650) or actually requiring a contract between gig service provider and the gig service user if the transfers are regular and /or substantial or is the only means of support by the gig worker.

We will monitor the platform and aim for a healthy balance between the interest of all concerned and use game theory to help balance the scales to be fair when feasible and aim to be forward thinking and anticipate possible legislation in this front to minimize legal risks.

## 5. Company

Our company is a pre seed software development firm that has yet to incorporate and plan to do so in Germany or a suitable EU country. We have been discussing and refining our ideas for sometime already and convinced by the necessity and viability of this idea is now applying at various accelerators and incubators to achieve initial product market fit then scale up.

The core founding team is mixed and diverse with one female out of three one asian out of three and one non binary out of three.

In the long run we will also use our platform as a hiring tool stripping race, gender, sexual orientation, age and religion and even appearance in hiring decisions via a job seeker persona to focus solely on the pertinent skills and potential for growth by the individual, unrelated to those superficial traits.

We have already reserved some shares for future key employees and / or cofounders.

We have strong Python, C#, SQL, Scrum/Project Management, Data Science skills and hard science skills among the core team. We seem to be missing front end as well as UX/UI graphics artists and designers as well as some dev ops and data engineering talent, marketing, legal, etc. EU funding will help us fill these gaps, create jobs in the EU and help us fulfill our vision for a pro social social network with positive dynamics that will be a vanguard for European values in a space that is dominated by the US and China.

## 7. Funding request

We are high conviction entrepreneurs that want high conviction investors that share our vision of a better virtual and real world mediated and facilitated by social media which is only the latest iteration of information technology of which [Europe once had a lead via the printing press.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Gutenberg) Historically that [old German information tech led to the enlightenment](https://empiresandruins.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/impact-of-the-printing-press-on-enlightenment/). We have to regain that lead again and we need a extensive funding up to TRL 9 so we are opting for blended finance up to the full amount allowed by the EIC of 17.5 million Euro. We are aware that we are giving away 25% the company in exchange for financing but at the moment we have yet to find substantial initial investors in this project and we are in bootstrap mode spending our own time and money building prototypes and refining this idea. We have done internal computations that showed 2.5 million Euro maybe just barely going to cover our labour expenses for 2 years and hence we are opting for the [blended finance model](https://eic.ec.europa.eu/eic-fund-equity-investments-beneficiaries_en). We do need all that to build and market this platform since we got well financed competitors in this space. We have some ideas already for our Go To Market Strategy and a subscription model for revenue. We will be a good and sustainable investment for EU funds and really aim to get unicorn status so that the funds will have outsize returns in both financial and social sense.  We maybe on the cusp of a new enlightenment due to these social media technologies but sadly it had led to fake news, [identity politics and social media bubbles](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/problem-social-media-reinforcement-bubbles-what-you-can-do-about-ncna1063896). We will break up these bubbles by promoting free discussion and exposure to various viewpoints and ideas and hope to promote synthesis of new ideas and maybe even companies or non profits. We can even be the platform that EIC could use itself to promote startups in Europe itself and worldwide and make the EU the next big player in the infotech space.
