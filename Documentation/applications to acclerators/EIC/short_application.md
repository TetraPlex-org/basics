# EIC Accelerator Program Short Application

## 1. Problem/market opportunity

There is no European Superapp or Social Media platform with payments and workflow built-in that can compete with the Chinese and even the existing American Social Media giants and there have been growing concerns over the security of Chinese Social Media platforms as well as toxicity and lack of adequate moderation of the ad driven American Social Media giants. There has also been concern over these social media giants collecting too much information about us so that we are fed ads or worse state actors use them to monitor or control their citizens or gather intel against perceived opponents.

We need a European champion in this area that will promote liberal western values and be a platform for open debate and discussion without the toxicity of the current web 2.0 platforms or the immaturity of the web 3.0 frameworks. If we are to classify ourselves we are maybe web 2.5. Almost all the technology required for implementing this is mature and matches TRL requirements and we can step in and be the European Superapp that would be both trustworthy being based in Europe where we really care about data privacy and governance and be pro social without doing social engineering Chinese style.

Innovations come in many forms and it doesn’t have to be technical. Lots of mature technologies can be applied in ways that are innovative in a social or business sense. We want a social network that can even be used in the third world and hence mature technologies applied in a socially conscious manner maybe appropriate to target high growth markets. We may have a few technical innovations in the works but we will allow our app to be on low end smart phones and laptops used in the third world and these are optional if they want to participate in a global conversation or transact globally on our platform to actually do action on local matters that may matter in a global scale.

We could bring the world together without dissolving identity differences like the way the EU brought together former adversaries and deepen understanding at an individual as well as in a transnational level. We want a safe space for discussions and transactions online where we can all agree to disagree safely without the toxicity of existing platforms and find common ground and cooperate on matters of upmost importance.


## 2. The Innovation: Solution/Product or Services (USP)

We are proposing a social network that doesn’t profile their users like the incumbents in the space and lets the users fine tune their exposure to the virtual and real world via constructed identities called “Personas” while at the same time being a safe space due to feedback mechanisms like Karma attached to a hidden underlying identity that you can selectively reveal to members of the network that have gained your trust.

Trust can only be built with time and our system allows you to interact via personas in the system with others and this can be a lot of fun. If you are into Science Fiction you can have a Vulcan persona, etc and this is less boring than being yourself in a social network to show off or brag. If you brag in our network you may get negative karma so you may get to see less of that and other irritating interactions.  You can be playful, explore gender identity by adopting a female persona if you are male or vice versa, etc.

People can use these personas to explore communities in the network that accept them as they are without being judged or bullied others not having that persona type and this is useful for minorities and people subjected to discrimination for race, belief, sexual orientation, etc.

This persona can eventually be a 3D avatar like in VR Chat but we can implement this as 2D at first so that people can use our app even in underpowered mobile devices. Lots of people already use personas online to be less shy and socially awkward notably the furry community. We think the persona concept as an identity facade is something that others communities may benefit from rather than a niche concept found in a few online communities and marketing literature. We are proposing a social network in which identity is fluid while having ways to determine who to trust based on prior interactions in the platform via karma and skill ratings attached to the underlying identity behind the persona.


## 3. Market and Competition analysis

We are primarily competing in the [Anonymous Social Media space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_social_media) and the [general social media space](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/social-networking/worldwide)

As for the anonymous Social Media space the players there may lack moderation and hence these aren't mainstream and there have been [reports of harassment and cyber bullying on these platforms](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/10/living/parents-new-apps-bullying/index.html)

[Facebook and the old traditional social media can be seen as uncool by kids.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-midlife-crisis-boomerbook/620307/) that now maybe trying out these newer social media sites and apps and some of these are anonymous.

We aim to be the cool new anonymous social media platform while being safe for use due to karma and kid personas for the underaged.


## 4. Broad Impacts

Aside from the direct jobs created in the EU as well as attracting qualified labor and talent into the EU rather than in China or the US, our platform can create part-time jobs as a gig economy platform via bounties and commissions set for various tasks by network participants in a global scale.

We aim to [address concerns that these gig economy platforms are platforms for worker exploitation](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/the-gig-is-up-on-21st-century-exploitation/) rather than empowerment by giving more power to the gig economy participants to set parameters on engagement be it by reversing the model and making others bid for your time and effort via [commission slots](https://www.reddit.com/r/artbusiness/comments/v8l1rs/what_are_commission_slots_and_what_exactly_is/?rdt=63650) or actually requiring a contract between gig service provider and the gig service user if the transfers are regular and /or substantial or is the only means of support by the gig worker.

We will monitor the platform and aim for a healthy balance between the interest of all concerned and use game theory to help balance the scales to be fair when feasible and aim to be forward thinking and anticipate possible legislation in this front to minimize legal risks.

## 5. Company

Our company is a pre seed software development firm that has yet to incorporate and plan to do so in Germany or a suitable EU country. We have been discussing and refining our ideas for sometime already and convinced by the necessity and viability of this idea is now applying at various accelerators and incubators to achieve initial product market fit then scale up.

The core founding team is mixed and diverse with one female out of three one asian out of three.

We can in the long run use or platform as a hiring tool stripping race, gender, sexual orientation, age and religion and even appearance in hiring decisions via a job seeker persona that eliminate those and just focus on the pertiment skills and potential for growth by the individual that are not correlated to those factors in general.

We have already reserved some shares  for future key employees and / or
cofounders.

We have strong Python, C#, SQL and Data Science skills and hard science skills among the core technical team. We seem to be missing front end as well as UX/UI graphics artists and designers as well as some dev ops and data engineering talent, marketing, legal, etc  and EU funding can help us fill these gaps, create jobs in the EU and help us fulfill our vision for a pro social social network with positive dynamics that will be a vanguard for European values in a space that is dominated by the US and China.
