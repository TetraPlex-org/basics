# 3 minute pitch

##  Problems

1. social media is toxic
- trolls
- online bullying
2. too much ads
3. hard to get answers online
4. privacy concerns
5. security concerns

## Solutions

1. Karma system and community based moderation
  - no perma ban only temporary access restriction
  - karma is used to access resources and limit trolls
2. Ads are voluntary in exchange for Karma or
   Pay subscription for ad free experience
3. Veiled Group QA
4. Persona System
   - Person as identity facade
   - One user many personas for different use cases (dating persona is different from work persona or play persona)
   - Network functionality can morph depending on Persona Type used
   - Create / delete personas as you grow (granular right to be forgotten)
   - Better than alts use one user login to monitor all your personas
   - all karma / credit accrue to user not persona
 5. OTR Chat and honey token support
