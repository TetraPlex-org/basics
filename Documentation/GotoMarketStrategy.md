# Go to Market Strategy

## I. Personas

* Alice wants to have her questions answered but is too shy to ask the questions fearing that her online reputation maybe tarnished

* Bob wants to have serious discussions and debates with like minded individuals and / or idea generation sessions

* Carol is not serious at all just wants to have fun with people online, socialize and possibly use the app to make friends since she is socially awkward. She uses the veiled chats to overcome this and make friends.

* Dave is a role player and a serious fan of Star Trek. He wants to have fun and chat with random people as Spock.

* Eva works in the US as a nurse and miss her very young children in the Philippines. She uses our platform to chat with them using fun kid friendly personas sometimes and use our credit system to send cash home with less fees.

* Frank is an entrepreneur and wants someone to test his new web platform. He pays credits to the system, the system takes transaction fees and a freelance tester does the task and files a report for a bounty claim, the tester gets paid in credits after Frank sees the report.

* James is a furry and wants a üêª avatar... he sets a bounty for his furry persona (fursona) and a graphics artist designs a reference sheet for his üêª OC (Original Character) based on the character bio and description that was on the bounty. The graphics artist was paid credits after the avatar and ref sheet was reviewed and accepted. James now uses the üêª avatar in Tetraplex and is very happy and commissions the same artist for his ü¶ù avatar and ref sheet.
