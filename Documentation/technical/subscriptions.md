# Subscriptions
Beside micro-transactions to get karma or credits, the other way is a subscription-based model. Both micro-transactions and subscriptions cover different cases and are not mutually exclusive. However, from an investor-perspective, subscriptions are more interesting, because they provide a more stable income.
There are different subscription models we can apply and combine.

## Lifetime Subscription
A lifetime subscription is a one-time payment that gives a user access to all features for the lifetime of the product. This is most attractive for a user, because it is a one-time payment and you don't have to worry about future payments. It is also attractive for investors and us in the beginning because it covers initial costs to ramp up development, but it is not a sustainable model in the long run, because it doesn't provide a stable income to cover ongoing costs.

The lifetime subscription can only be used to unlock features, but not to buy karma that counts as earned or credits, which could be used to exploit the system and actually draw money from it over time.

A feasible price for a lifetime subscription would be around 100€, which is a reasonable price to cover initial costs and still be attractive for users. The subscription effectively means infinite amount of *gifted karma*, which can't be traded or gifted to other users, but can only be used to unlock features.

## Monthly and Annual Subscription
A recurring subscription is a subscription that is renewed every month or every year. This is the most attractive model for investors, because it provides a stable income. It is also attractive for users, because it is a relatively small amount of money that is paid every month or every year, which is easier to pay than a one-time payment of 100€. It is also attractive for us, because it provides a stable income to cover ongoing costs. It is also easier to calculate and possible to give a substantial discount.

The monthly and annual subscription only make sense as a way to get credits and "earned karma", which can be freely traded (but doesn't count towards the lifetime karma score). Since it is a recurring subscription, it is not critical to limit the user to *gifted karma* since it can't be exploited to draw money from the system.

### Prices
A feasible price for a monthly subscription would be around 5€, which is a reasonable price to cover ongoing costs and still be attractive for users. A feasible price for an annual subscription would be around 50€, which is a reasonable price to cover ongoing costs and still be attractive for users.

### Benefits
The subscription would essentially work as a multiplicator for the amount of *earned karma* gained by positive interactions with the system. For example, if you have a subscription, you would get 2x the amount of *earned karma*.

It would also give a discount on micro-transactions and the exchange, for example 10% off. This would make it more attractive to buy credits and karma, which would in turn make it more attractive for investors.

Lastly, it would provide a bonus on *gifted karma* for logging in every day, for example 50% more *gifted karma*.

## Gifting Subscriptions
It is possible to gift a one-time subscription (for a month/year) to another user as an item. This is a good way to get new users into the system, because it is a nice way to get access to features and make an impact for a limited time. It is also a good way to reward users for their contributions to the community. It is also a good way to get users to invite their friends to the system, because they can gift them a subscription.
