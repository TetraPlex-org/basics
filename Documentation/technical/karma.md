# Karma
Karma is a measure of how much you have helped the community. Karma is used to unlock any and all community-related features, so you can only use them if you have enough karma. Karma in general **cannot be transferred directly** to other users.
There are two kinds of karma: gifted and earned. Gifted karma is given to you by the system for free, just by logging on over time, but it can't be traded on the exchange for credits. Earned karma is can be gained by doing things like helping other users, reporting bugs, and contributing to the codebase and content.

## Unlocking features
Every community-related feature has a base price, which is multiplied by the current global karma-level, determined by the total amount of karma in the system devided by the number of active users. This means that the more people flood the system with karma, the more expensive it will be to unlock features. This is to prevent people from flooding the system with karma to unlock features, and then selling their karma on the exchange. Having a base price per feature puts all features into relation to each other, so that the system can be balanced.

The current karma price per feature is calculated as follows:

   feature_price = base_price * (total_karma / active_users) * adjustment_factor * lag_factor

where lag_factor is a factor that is applied to the price to prevent the price from changing too quickly, and adjustment_factor is a global factor that can be used to adjust the price of all features at once to balance the system if necessary.

## Gifted Karma
The easiest way to gain karma to unlock features is to log on every day. Every day you log on, you will be gifted a certain amount of karma, depending on how many days you have logged on in a row and whether you have taken long enough breaks to sleep.
When spending karma to unlock features, the system will always use your gifted karma first, so you don't have to worry about spending your earned karma.


## Earned Karma
You earn karma by helping users, reporting bugs, and contributing to the codebase and content. You can also buy and sell earned karma on the exchange. Earning karma (not buying it) counts towards your lifetime karma score, which can be shown on your profile as a badge.

## Lifetime Karma Score
Gifted karma can't be traded on the exchange for credits and it doesn't count towards your lifetime karma score. Only earned karma counts towards your lifetime karma score. The lifetime karma score is a measure of how much you have contributed to the community over time. It is used to determine your reputation and trustworthiness. The more karma you have earned, the more trustworthy you are. It has no other purpose other than to demonstrate your status in the community, since it cannot be bought, only earned.

## Transferring Karma
As already pointed out, karma in general cannot be transferred directly. It can however be exchanged for credits on the exchange, which can then be used to buy karma from other users. The only other way to transfer earned karma indirectly is to turn it into a gift-item and send the item to another user. This only is allowed in certain cases, like when a senpai wants to reward a kohai for their hard work. The senpai can then turn their earned karma into a gift-item and send it to the kohai. The kohai can then turn the gift-item back into karma, which will be added to their earned karma score. Another special occassion where this can be acceptable is for example when a user has been offline for a long time for some reason or for holidays like christmas. Only the intented recipient can turn the gift-item back into karma, so it is safe to send gift-items to other users.

## Subscriptions
As described in more detail in *subscriptions.md*, there are different subscription models we can apply and combine. A lifetime subscription would essentially act as an infinite amount of *gifted karma*. A monthly or annual subscription on the other hand would act as a multiplicator for the amount of *earned karma* gained by positive interactions with the system. It would also give a discount on micro-transactions and the exchange, for example 10% off. Lastly, it would provide a bonus on *gifted karma* for logging in every day, for example 50% more *gifted karma* while active.

Subscriptions can be bought as gift-items and passed on to other users, with no limitation on how many times they can be passed on. This is a good way to reward users for their contributions to the community and it is also a good way to get users to invite their friends to the system, because they can gift them a subscription.
