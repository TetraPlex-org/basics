# Names
Identity is a fundamental concept in tetraplex. It doesn't start or end with the veil, accounts or personas but even earlier, before creating an account.

## Names before Account Creation
In order to create an account, you need an invitation link from someone who already is a user. To facilitate getting an invitation, we provide a general chat area, consisting of multiple chat rooms, where users can ask for an invitation. This chat area is called the *Prancing Pony*. The name is a reference to the inn in Bree, where Frodo and his companions meet Aragorn for the first time, not knowing anything about him. This is a good analogy for the situation in the Prancing Pony chat area, where users meet for the first time, not knowing anything about each other. The Prancing Pony has multiple chat rooms, all having in common that you don't need an account to join them.

### Only Humans Allowed
To ensure that we don't get flooded by bots, there are two mechanisms. Firstly, we employ the use of a CAPTCHA to filter out simple bots. Secondly, you need to earn the trust of the community before you can get an invitation. This is done by a mechanism similar to the one used in zooniverse, a citizen-scientist platform, where users are tasked to categorize things, most often images. To ensure that the user doesn't just give random answers, each batch of questions/images are mixed with a few known answers. If the user answers the known answers correctly, the user is considered trustworthy and their answers are put into a pool of answers that are used to train our own AI tools.
This way, we can ensure that the user is a human and not a bot and that the user actually wants to join the community and is not just there to spam or troll.

### What's in a Name?
When you get into the Prancing Pony, you cannot choose or change your own name or your personal profile. Instead, you are identified with a combination of a random adjective and a random animal name. This is done to ensure that you don't get identified by your name, but by your actions. Until you have an account, you can't register this name or change it.

### Invitation, please
Once you got an invitation link, you can create an account. On account creation, some karma is gifted to you, which you can use to unlock the privilege to choose your own name. This is a nice way to introduce the concept of karma to new users and to give them a sense of ownership and responsibility for their own account. Since this is a karma feature, it can be disabled as a punishment for bad behaviour, like using abusive names.

## Names after Account Creation
### Account: Call_Name
On creation of an Account, the user is asked how they want to be addressed internally, by us, in the UI, emails and such. This is not associated in any way with the legal name of the user and it is not visible to other users. The user can change this name at any time, it is not a karma-feature and has nothing to do with other users. It is just a way for us to address the user in a way that they prefer. This is not required to be unique, since it is not used to identify the user in any way.

### LegalEntity: Legal_Name
For the purpose of buying credits and other legal stuff, the user needs to provide a legal name. This is not visible to other users but it is used to identify the user in legal documents. This name is not used outside of the legal context, including re-claiming the account, if the user loses access to it and needs to prove that they are the owner of the account. This is not a karma feature, but it can't be changed without a good reason, since it is used in legal documents. To change this name, the user needs to contact us and provide a good reason for the change.

### Persona: Persona_Name
To interact with other users, the user needs to create a persona. Part of the persona is a name. Changing this name is a karma feature, since it is used to identify the user in the community. The user can have multiple personas.
